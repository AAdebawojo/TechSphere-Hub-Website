  <div class="container">
    <p>This Refund Policy governs refund requests for all online courses, digital resources, registrations, and certifications offered by TechSphere Hub Academy (“we,” “our,” or “us”).</p>

    <h2>1. Scope</h2>
    <p>This policy applies to payments made for our online courses, learning materials, and certifications. Certificates include both the TechSphere Hub Certificate of Completion and, for applicable programs, the Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Certification (PL-300).</p>

    <h2>2. Full Refund – Before Course Start</h2>
    <p>Participants are entitled to a full refund if they request cancellation before the official course start date. Requests must be made in writing via email.</p>

    <h2>3. Partial Refund – Within One Month After Start</h2>
    <p>If a refund request is made within one (1) month of the course start date, seventy-five percent (75%) of the total course fee will be refunded. No refunds will be processed after this period.</p>

    <h2>4. Non-Refundable Situations</h2>
    <p>There are no fixed non-refundable registration or material fees. However, refunds may be denied if a participant has accessed substantial digital course content or received a certificate of completion.</p>

    <h2>5. Payment Platforms and Processing</h2>
    <p>Refunds are processed through our approved payment platforms, <strong>Paystack</strong> or <strong>Moniepoint</strong>, and will be credited to the original payment method within three to five (3–5) business days after approval. We are not liable for delays caused by banks or payment processors.</p>

    <h2>6. How to Request a Refund</h2>

    <p>Where required, administrative adjustments may be deducted from the refund amount. Such deductions will be detailed in the refund confirmation email.</p>
